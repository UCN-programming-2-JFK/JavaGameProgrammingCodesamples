- hiding mouse cursor and using graphical cursor, indicating possibilities (attack/move/no action) to signal what's possible with what the cursor is over
- juicing stuff up (visual effects, bounce, glow, etc.)
- menu (active and inactive visual component with drawing from the correct menu) (menu items with hidden color to figure out what item the mouse is over
- finite state machine (attack, eat, flee)
- particle systems
- composite components (child-components position and scale with the parent)
